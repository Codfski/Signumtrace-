Phase 1: AI-Assisted Problem Definition

Task 1.1: AI-Generate Research Questions
✓ Current: Broad domain interest
▶ Action: Use AI (GPT-4, Claude) to generate 20+ research questions
⚙ Implementation:
import openai

def generate_research_questions(domain, constraints):
    prompt = f"Generate novel AI research questions in {domain}"
    return openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
# Target: 20+ novel questions, 5+ with high feasibility
☑ Validation: Human researcher selects top 3, AI ranks feasibility
👤 Owner: Lead Researcher + AI Assistant
⏱️ 2 days
🚩 AI hallucination, derivative ideas
⟿ ◉ If 3+ promising questions → Proceed
   ◉ If none viable → Human-led question formulation ↻

Task 1.2: AI-Augmented Literature Review
✓ Current: Manual review overwhelming
▶ Action: AI-assisted systematic review
⚙ Implementation:
# AI literature analyzer
def analyze_papers(papers):
    # Extract key insights, identify gaps
    # Cluster similar work
    # Generate citation graphs
    pass
# Target: 50+ papers reviewed, gaps mapped
☑ Validation: Human spot-check 10% for accuracy
👤 Owner: Researcher + AI Agent
⏱️ 1 week
🚩 AI misses seminal papers, bias in selection
⟿ ◉ If comprehensive → Proceed
   ◉ If gaps identified → Expand search ↻

Phase 2: AI-Human Co-Development

Task 2.1: AI Prototype Generation
✓ Research question defined
▶ Action: Generate 3+ prototype implementations using AI
⚙ Implementation:
# Prompt to AI coding assistant:
"Implement a prototype for [research question] 
using [framework]. Include tests and evaluation."
# Target: 3 working prototypes, each <200 LOC
☑ Validation: Human review for conceptual correctness
👤 Owner: AI Agent (primary), Human (review)
⏱️ 3 days
🚩 Generated code buggy, conceptual errors
⟿ ◉ If 1+ viable prototype → Human refinement
   ◉ If all fail → Adjust prompt/approach ↻

---

Task 2.2: Human-in-the-Loop Refinement
✓ AI-generated prototypes
▶ Action: Human refinement with AI assistance
⚙ Implementation:
# Human-AI pair programming session
# 1. Human identifies issues
# 2. AI suggests fixes
# 3. Human approves/rejects
# Target: Production-ready code, tests, documentation
☑ Validation: Unit tests pass, performance benchmarks
👤 Owner: Human (70%), AI (30%)
⏱️ 1 week
🚩 Over-reliance on AI, loss of understanding
⟿ ◉ If meets standards → Evaluation phase
   ◉ If quality issues → More human intervention ↻

---

Phase 3: AI-Enhanced Evaluation

Task 3.1: Automated Experimentation
✓ Model implemented
▶ Action: AI-managed hyperparameter search and evaluation
⚙ Implementation:
# AutoML-style optimization
ai_experiment_runner = AILab(
    model=model,
    search_space=search_space,
    objective="accuracy",
    compute_budget="100 GPU-hours"
)
results = ai_experiment_runner.optimize()
# Target: Optimal configuration found, statistical significance
☑ Validation: Human review of methodology, AI handles execution
👤 Owner: AI Agent (execution), Human (design)
⏱️ 2 weeks (parallel compute)
🚩 Cost overruns, cherry-picked results
⟿ ◉ If statistically significant → Writeup
   ◉ If inconclusive → Adjust experiment design ↻

---

Task 3.2: AI-Assisted Paper Writing
✓ Results validated
▶ Action: AI-assisted paper generation with human orchestration
⚙ Implementation:
1. AI drafts sections based on results
2. Human provides feedback, edits
3. AI revises, checks formatting
4. Human final approval
# Target: Conference-ready paper, reproducible results
☑ Validation: AI plagiarism check, human peer review
👤 Owner: Human (content), AI (editing/formatting)
⏱️ 2 weeks
🚩 AI-generated text lacks nuance, plagiarism
⟿ ◉ If accepted → Conference + blog post
   ◉ If rejected → Human-led rewrite for next venue ↻

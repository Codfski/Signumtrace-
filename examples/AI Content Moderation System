# AI Content Moderation System

Project Overview
✓ Project: Automated content moderation for 10M user platform
✓ Timeline: 6 months (26 weeks)
✓ Goal: 70% automation, <2hr response time, 50% cost reduction
👤 Project Lead: [Name]

Current State
✓ Moderation: 80% manual, costs $5M/year
✓ Response time: 24 hours average
✓ Bad content exposure: 8 hours average
✓ Team: 5 engineers, $500K budget
✓ Languages: English + Arabic
⟿ Problem: Manual moderation doesn't scale, too slow, too expensive

---

Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

Task 1.1: Data Analysis
✓ Current: Moderation decisions in production DB
▶ Action: Extract and analyze 3 months of decisions
⚙ Implementation:
SELECT content_id, content_text, violation_type, 
       moderator_decision, language, created_at
FROM moderation_queue
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '3 months'
  AND moderator_decision IS NOT NULL;
# Target: 50K labeled examples, violation distribution mapped
☑ Validation: CSV export with clear distribution
👤 Owner: ML Engineer 1
⏱️ Deadline: Day 5
🔗 Depends on: Database read access granted
🚩 Risk: Arabic content under-represented (<20%)
⟿ ◉ If <20% Arabic → supplement with labeling
   ◉ If balanced → proceed to classification

---

Task 1.2: Classification System (MVP)
✓ Historical data analyzed
▶ Action: Deploy LLM classifier using Claude API
⚙ Implementation:
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

def classify_content(text, language):
    prompt = f"""Analyze this {language} content for violations.
    
Violation types: hate_speech, spam, violence, sexual, none

Content: {text}

Return JSON:
{{"violation_type": "...", "confidence": 0.0-1.0}}"""
    
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        max_tokens=500,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response
# Target: API returns violation + confidence in <3 seconds
☑ Validation: Test with 100 examples
👤 Owner: Backend Engineer 1
⏱️ Deadline: Day 12
🚩 Risk: API rate limits
⟿ ◉ If latency >5s → implement caching
   ◉ If works well → proceed to queue system

---

Phase 2: Queue & Routing (Week 3-4)

Task 2.1: Priority Queue System
✓ Classification API working
▶ Action: Build routing logic based on confidence scores
⚙ Implementation:
def route_content(result):
    confidence = result['confidence']
    
    if confidence > 0.95:
        return auto_moderate(result)
    elif confidence > 0.80:
        return urgent_review_queue(result)
    else:
        return normal_review_queue(result)
# Target: Content routed in <1 second
☑ Validation: 100 test items correctly routed
👤 Owner: Backend Engineer 2
⏱️ Deadline: Day 18
🚩 Risk: Thresholds need tuning
⟿ ◉ After 1 week → optimize thresholds

---

Phase 3: Pilot Launch (Week 5-8)

Task 3.1: A/B Test
✓ All systems built and tested
▶ Action: Route 10% through AI, compare with humans
# Target: AI agrees with humans ≥85%
☑ Validation: Daily agreement rate reports
👤 Owner: ML Engineer 1
⏱️ Deadline: Day 35
🚩 Risk: Sample may not represent diversity
⟿ ◉ If agreement <80% → pause, analyze
   ◉ If ≥85% → proceed to 40% rollout

---

Phase 4: Scale & Optimization (Week 9-26)

Task 4.1: Full Rollout
✓ A/B test successful (≥85% agreement)
▶ Action: Scale to 100% of content
⚙ Implementation:
- Week 9-12: 40% traffic
- Week 13-16: 70% traffic
- Week 17-20: 90% traffic
- Week 21-26: 100% traffic with monitoring
# Target: Full automation by Week 26
☑ Validation: No system degradation, maintain ≥85% agreement
👤 Owner: Platform Lead
⏱️ Week 9-26
🚩 Risk: Scaling issues, performance degradation
⟿ ◉ If stable → Continue rollout
   ◉ If issues → Rollback 20% and debug ↻

---

Task 4.2: Cost Optimization
✓ System running at scale
▶ Action: Reduce operational costs
⚙ Implementation:
1. Implement model caching (reduce API calls by 40%)
2. Batch processing for non-urgent content
3. Fine-tune smaller model for common cases
4. Implement cold storage for old training data
# Target: Reduce $5M → $2.5M annual cost
☑ Validation: Monthly cost reports show reduction
👤 Owner: Finance + Engineering
⏱️ Continuous optimization
🚩 Risk: Cost optimization reduces accuracy
⟿ ◉ If costs down, accuracy stable → Continue
   ◉ If accuracy drops → Revert optimization ↻

```

✓ 80% manual → 70% automation
✓ $5M/year → $2.5M/year cost
✓ 24hr response → <2hr response
✓ Single language → English + Arabic support

```

**Key SignumTrace Features Used:**
- Symbolic progress tracking (✓ ⟿ ▶ #)
- Risk management (🚩) for language bias, API limits
- Conditional logic (⟿ ◉) for A/B test decisions
- Clear ownership (👤) across 5 engineers
- Timeline management (⏱️) across 26 weeks

**Impact:** Real production system managing 10M users with measurable ROI.
